## 🔧 Integration with Your Existing Code

### AudioManager (Already Perfect!)
```csharp
// Your AudioManager.cs already has everything needed
AudioManager.Instance.PlayMusic(SoundType.RelaxingGuitar);
AudioManager.Instance.PlaySFX(SoundType.Stamp);
AudioManager.Instance.PlaySFX(SoundType.Pop, volume: 0.3f);
```

### StateManager (Just Add One State)
```csharp
// Add to your AppState enum
public enum AppState
{
    None,
    MainMenu,
    Characters,  // ← Add this line
    FakeNews,
    Profile,
    Ending,
    GameStart
}
```

### EventManager (Optional Enhancement)
```csharp
// Add custom events if you want
public static event EventController.MethodContainer OnCharacterSelected;
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Asset Organization
```
Your assets are in good shape! Consider organizing:
Assets/Art/ → Assets/Art/Characters/, Assets/Art/Backgrounds/, etc.
This will make it easier to find things as the project grows.
```

### AI Generation Strategy
```
Generate portraits during development, then save them permanently.
Don't regenerate every time - cache the results!
This saves API costs and load times.
```

### Performance Optimization
```
Use CircleMask.png for all character portraits (you already have it!)
This creates consistent circular portraits and looks professional.
```

### Audio Feedback
```
Your audio library is excellent! Use:
- Pop sound for hover (subtle)
- Stamp sound for selection (satisfying)
- Correct sound for confirmation (rewarding)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Characters don't appear in scene"
→ Check CharacterDatabase is assigned to CharacterSelectionManager

### "AI generation fails"
→ Test with AIBackendTester first, verify API URL is correct

### "Sounds don't play"
→ Ensure AudioManager exists and is configured with your sounds

### "Scene looks wrong"
→ Follow UnitySceneSetupGuide.md step-by-step, check Canvas Scaler settings
