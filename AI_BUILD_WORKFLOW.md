## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Build with Version Control Safety**

### **STEP 1: Create Pre-Build Checkpoint** ⏸️

**In Unity DevOps Window:**

1. Look at **"Pending Changes"** tab
2. You should see files that were modified recently
3. **Review the changes**:
   - Click on each file to see what changed
   - Green lines = additions
   - Red lines = deletions
4. **Add a comment**:
   ```
   Pre-build checkpoint - Executive Disorder ready for first build
   Added: BUILD_CHECKLIST.md
   Status: All managers configured, no errors
   ```
5. Click **"Checkin"** button
6. **Result**: You now have a safe point to return to!

---

### **STEP 2: Create Build Branch** 🌿

**Why?** Keeps your main code safe while you experiment with build settings.

**In Unity DevOps:**

1. Click **"Branches"** in left sidebar
2. Right-click on **"main"** branch
3. Select **"Create child branch"**
4. Name it: `build/webgl-first-attempt`
5. Click **"Create"**
6. **Switch to this branch**

**Or use VS Code terminal:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\POK28\source\repos\ExecutiveDisorderReplit
git checkout -b build/webgl-first-attempt
git push -u origin build/webgl-first-attempt
```

---

### **STEP 3: Unity Assistant Build Walkthrough** 🤖

**Open Unity Assistant in Unity Editor and paste this:**

```
I'm ready to build Executive Disorder for WebGL. I'm a Unity beginner.

Current situation:
- No console errors ✅
- All scripts compiled successfully ✅
- MainMenu scene is open
- Version Control is tracking changes
- Created build branch: build/webgl-first-attempt

Walk me through step-by-step:

1. First, verify Build Settings:
   - What scenes should be included?
   - What order should they be in?
   - Are there any platform-specific settings I need?

Show me exactly where to click in the Unity Editor UI.
```

**Unity Assistant will respond with specific UI instructions.**

---

### **STEP 4: Follow Build Checklist with AI Help** 📋

Open `BUILD_CHECKLIST.md` and work through each section.

**For EACH section, ask Unity Assistant:**

#### **Section: Build Settings**
```
Unity Assistant: I need to configure Build Settings.
1. Show me how to open File → Build Settings
2. How do I add all 4 scenes (MainMenu, GamePlay, LoadingScreen, EndingCinematic)?
3. What's the correct scene order?
4. How do I switch platform to WebGL?
```

#### **Section: Player Settings - WebGL**
```
Unity Assistant: Configure WebGL Player Settings:
1. Where is Edit → Project Settings → Player?
2. Walk me through Company Name, Product Name, Version
3. What WebGL-specific settings do I need to change?
4. What compression format should I use for a card game?
```

#### **Section: Asset Optimization**
```
Unity Assistant: Optimize my assets for WebGL build:
1. How do I select all character portrait sprites?
2. What import settings should I use for 2D card game images?
3. How do I compress audio files properly?
4. Show me the Inspector settings to change
```

---

### **STEP 5: Commit After Each Major Change** 💾

**After Unity Assistant helps you complete each section:**

**In Unity DevOps → Pending Changes:**

1. Review what files changed
2. Add descriptive comment:
   ```
   ✅ Build Settings configured
   - Added all 4 scenes
   - Set WebGL platform
   - Configured compression
   
   Next: Player Settings optimization
   ```
3. Click **"Checkin"**

**Repeat for each major section:**
- ✅ Build Settings
- ✅ Player Settings
- ✅ Quality Settings
- ✅ Asset Optimization

---

### **STEP 6: Pre-Build Test** 🧪

**Ask Unity Assistant:**

```
Before I build, help me test:
1. How do I enter Play Mode and test the game?
2. What should I check to verify everything works?
3. How do I exit Play Mode properly?
4. Should I clear the Console before building?
```

**Then manually test:**
- Press **Play** button in Unity
- Click through menus
- Draw a card
- Check resources update
- Verify audio plays
- Press **Play** again to stop

**If errors appear:**
```
Unity Assistant: I got these errors in Play Mode:
[paste error messages]

How do I fix them?
```

---

### **STEP 7: First Build Attempt** 🏗️

**Ask Unity Assistant:**

```
I'm ready to build. Walk me through:
1. File → Build Settings → WebGL → Build (not Build and Run)
2. Where should I save the build output?
3. How long will this take?
4. What should I do while it builds?
5. How do I know if it succeeded?
```

**Recommended build output location:**
```
c:\Users\POK28\source\repos\ExecutiveDisorderReplit\Builds\WebGL\v1.0\
```

**During build (10-30 minutes):**
- Don't close Unity
- Don't modify files
- Watch the progress bar
- Check Console for warnings

---

### **STEP 8: Post-Build Verification** ✅

**After build completes:**

**Ask Unity Assistant:**

```
My build finished. Now what?
1. What files should I see in the build folder?
2. How do I test the WebGL build locally?
3. What browser should I use?
4. How do I know if it worked?
```

**Manual verification:**
1. Navigate to: `c:\Users\POK28\source\repos\ExecutiveDisorderReplit\Builds\WebGL\v1.0\`
2. You should see:
   - `index.html`
   - `Build/` folder
   - `TemplateData/` folder

**Don't double-click index.html!** (Won't work due to CORS)

---

### **STEP 9: Local Web Server Test** 🌐

**Option A: Use Python (if installed)**

**In VS Code terminal:**
```bash
cd c:\Users\POK28\source\repos\ExecutiveDisorderReplit\Builds\WebGL\v1.0\
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open browser: `http://localhost:8000`

**Option B: Use Node.js http-server**
```bash
cd c:\Users\POK28\source\repos\ExecutiveDisorderReplit\Builds\WebGL\v1.0\
npx http-server -p 8000
```

**Option C: Use Unity's Build and Run**
- In Build Settings, click "Build and Run"
- Unity will automatically serve it

**Option D: Ask me to help set up a server!**

---

### **STEP 10: Commit Successful Build** 🎉

**In Unity DevOps → Pending Changes:**

1. You'll see new build files
2. Add comment:
   ```
   🎉 First successful WebGL build v1.0
   
   Build completed: [Date/Time]
   Build size: [Check folder size]
   Platform: WebGL
   Compression: Gzip
   Tested: Chrome browser ✅
   
   Status: Playable build achieved!
   ```
3. Click **"Checkin"**

---

### **STEP 11: Tag This Release** 🏷️

**In Unity DevOps:**
1. Go to **"Labels"** tab
2. Create new label: `v1.0.0-webgl-first-build`
3. Add description: "First playable WebGL build"

**Or in terminal:**
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First playable WebGL build of Executive Disorder"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting with AI**

### **If Build Fails:**

**Ask Unity Assistant:**
```
My build failed with this error:
[paste error from Console]

How do I fix this? Show me step-by-step.
```

### **If Game Won't Load in Browser:**

**Ask Unity Assistant:**
```
My WebGL build created files, but the game shows a blank screen in browser.
I opened: http://localhost:8000
Browser console shows: [paste any errors]

What's wrong and how do I fix it?
```

### **If Build is Too Large:**

**Ask Unity Assistant:**
```
My WebGL build is [size] MB. This seems too large.
How do I optimize:
1. Texture compression
2. Audio compression
3. Code stripping
4. Asset bundle size

Show me the settings to change.
```
