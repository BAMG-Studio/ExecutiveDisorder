# AI/ML Integration Strategy

## Unity 6.2 AI Capabilities

### Core AI Systems
The project leverages Unity 6.2's advanced AI/ML features for end-to-end automation with minimal human interaction:

#### Unity Sentis
- **Purpose**: Neural network inference engine for runtime AI
- **Usage**: Powers AIContentGenerator and SentisInferenceManager
- **Benefits**: On-device ML inference without cloud dependencies
- **Implementation**: `Assets/Scripts/AI/SentisInferenceManager.cs`

#### ML-Agents
- **Purpose**: Reinforcement learning for gameplay testing and balancing
- **Usage**: PlayerSimulationAgent trains AI to play the game autonomously
- **Benefits**: Automated playtesting, difficulty balancing, bug detection
- **Implementation**: `Assets/Scripts/AI/PlayerSimulationAgent.cs`
- **Configuration**: `ML-Agents/ml-agents-config.yaml`

#### Unity Muse
- **Purpose**: AI-assisted content generation
- **Usage**: Generate cards, dialogue, narrative content, and visual assets
- **Benefits**: Rapid content creation with minimal manual authoring
- **Integration**: Works with AIContentGenerator for dynamic content

#### Addressables
- **Purpose**: Dynamic asset loading and management
- **Usage**: AIAssetManager handles runtime asset loading for AI-generated content
- **Benefits**: Efficient memory usage, streaming content delivery
- **Implementation**: `Assets/Scripts/AI/AIAssetManager.cs`

## Agentic AI Workflow

### Autonomous Content Pipeline
```
AI Content Request → Unity Muse Generation → Sentis Validation → Addressables Loading → Runtime Integration
```

### Automated Testing Pipeline
```
ML-Agents Training → Player Simulation → Balance Analysis → Automated Adjustments → Validation
```

### End-to-End Automation Goals
- **Content Creation**: AI generates cards, characters, and narrative without manual authoring
- **Asset Generation**: Automated creation of sprites, audio, and UI elements
- **Gameplay Testing**: ML agents play thousands of sessions to identify issues
- **Balance Tuning**: AI adjusts resource values and difficulty curves automatically
- **Quality Assurance**: Sentis validates content quality and consistency
- **Deployment**: Addressables enable dynamic content updates without rebuilds

## AI System Architecture
