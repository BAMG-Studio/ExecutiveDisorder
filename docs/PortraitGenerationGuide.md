## Troubleshooting

### "Backend not responding"
- Verify Flask backend is running
- Check API URL is correct
- Test with health endpoint first

### "Generation takes too long"
- DALL-E 3 can take 10-30 seconds per image
- Be patient, don't cancel requests
- Check backend logs for errors

### "Image quality is poor"
- Verify prompt includes "4K quality"
- Check DALL-E 3 settings in backend
- Try regenerating with adjusted prompt

### "Can't import to Unity"
- Verify PNG format
- Check file isn't corrupted
- Try re-downloading from backend

---

## Cost Estimate

**DALL-E 3 Pricing**: ~$0.040 per image (1024x1024)

**Total cost for 8 portraits**: ~$0.32

**Recommendation**: Generate once, save permanently, don't regenerate

---

## Next Steps After Generation

1. âœ… All 8 portraits generated
2. âœ… Imported to Unity
3. âœ… Assigned to character ScriptableObjects
4. âœ… Test in Character Selection scene
5. âœ… Verify CircleMask.png applied correctly
6. âœ… Check portrait quality in-game
7. âœ… Save portraits to version control

---

## Alternative: Use Placeholder Images

If AI generation isn't working, you can use existing portraits:

```
Dr. Evelyn Technocrat â†’ TheTechnocratPortrait.png (already have)
Senator Marcus Tradition â†’ MadamCashPortrait.png (already have)

For others, use:
- placeholderpresi.png
- Ironfist presido.png
- Or create simple colored circles with initials
```
