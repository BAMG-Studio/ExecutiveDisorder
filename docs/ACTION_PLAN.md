## 💰 Budget Considerations

### Current Costs (Replit Free Tier):
- Replit hosting: $0/month
- PostgreSQL: $0/month (Replit included)
- GitHub: $0/month (public repo)
- **Total: $0/month**

### Scaling Costs (Estimated):
- Replit Hacker: $7/month (more resources)
- Dedicated PostgreSQL: $15/month (better performance)
- CDN (Cloudflare): $0-20/month (faster assets)
- Monitoring (Sentry): $0-26/month (error tracking)
- **Total: $22-68/month**

### Production Costs (Estimated):
- Cloud hosting (AWS/Azure): $50-200/month
- Database (managed): $50-100/month
- CDN: $20-50/month
- Monitoring: $50-100/month
- **Total: $170-450/month**

## 🎯 Decision Points

### This Week:
**Decision:** Keep on Replit or migrate to dedicated hosting?
- ✅ **Keep on Replit** if: <100 users, testing phase, budget constrained
- ⚠️ **Migrate** if: >100 users, need more control, have budget

### This Month:
**Decision:** Focus on content or features?
- ✅ **Content** if: Current features sufficient, need more gameplay
- ✅ **Features** if: Content sufficient, need better UX

### Next Quarter:
**Decision:** Go mobile or stay web-only?
- ✅ **Mobile** if: Target mobile users, have Unity expertise
- ✅ **Web-only** if: Desktop focus, limited resources
