# Baseline Metrics

## Code
- Lines of C# code: 88,278
- C# files: 694 (tests: 5)
- Major systems: Disorder, Actions, Time (skeletons added)

## Build
- Warnings: TBD (requires build)
- WebGL build size: TBD (requires build)

## Performance (Editor proxy)
- Avg frame time: TBD
- GC allocations/frame: TBD

## Assets
- Assets/ size: 12.59 KB (core code only; assets pending)
- Texture/audio compression status: TBD

## Repository Size
- Total repository size: 2.30 GB (Library likely committed)

## Dependencies
- Unity packages (pinned): TBD (review `Packages/manifest.json`)

## Quick Wins
- [ ] Remove `Library/` from repo and .gitignore (reduces repo size dramatically)
- [ ] Verify `Packages/` lock and pin versions

## Risks/Blockers
- [ ] Large repo due to `Library/` impacts CI and clones
