# Workflow

## Daily Rhythm
- Morning: plan + assignments; Amazon Q briefs; Codex starts WPs
- Midday: check-in; unblock; share preliminary research
- Evening: PRs + research deliverables; Copilot reviews and compiles report

## Escalation
- Codex→Copilot: blockers within 2h; security immediately
- Copilot→BAMG: architecture/platform/pivots within 4h

## Change Management
- No scope/architecture change without Copilot approval; BAMG approves strategic pivots
- All changes via PR; tests + docs required
