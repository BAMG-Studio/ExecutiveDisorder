## 🎯 How Everything Works Together

### Character Selection Flow
```
1. Scene loads → CharacterSelectionManager.Start()
2. Reads CharacterDatabase (10 characters)
3. Instantiates CharacterCard prefab for each
4. Starts AI portrait generation (if needed)
5. Player hovers card → Pop sound + scale animation
6. Player clicks card → Stamp sound + show detail panel
7. Player clicks "Start Campaign" → Correct sound + load GameStart
```

### AI Integration Flow
```
1. Character has useAIPortrait = true
2. AICharacterGenerator.GenerateCharacterPortrait()
3. POST request to Flask backend with prompt
4. DALL-E 3 generates image
5. Texture2D received and converted to Sprite
6. Character.portrait updated
7. CharacterCard.UpdatePortrait() refreshes display
```

### Audio Integration Flow
```
1. Scene starts → AudioManager.PlayMusic(RelaxingGuitar)
2. Card hover → AudioManager.PlaySFX(Pop, volume: 0.3f)
3. Card select → AudioManager.PlaySFX(Stamp, volume: 0.8f)
4. Confirm → AudioManager.PlaySFX(Correct)
5. Scene exit → AudioManager.StopMusic(fadeSeconds: 1f)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Complete Implementation

### Step 1: Create ScriptableObjects in Unity
```
1. Open Unity Editor
2. Assets/ScriptableObjects/Characters/ (create folder)
3. Right-click → Create → Executive Disorder → Political Character
4. Create 10 assets using data from CharacterDataSetup.md
5. Create CharacterDatabase and add all 10 characters
```

### Step 2: Build Character Selection Scene
```
1. Follow UnitySceneSetupGuide.md step-by-step
2. Create Canvas with all UI elements
3. Create CharacterCard prefab
4. Setup CharacterSelectionManager
5. Assign all references in Inspector
```

### Step 3: Test AI Backend
```
1. Create empty GameObject in scene
2. Add AIBackendTester.cs component
3. Create simple UI with buttons and text
4. Update apiBaseUrl with your Replit URL
5. Press Play and test each endpoint
```

### Step 4: Generate Character Portraits
```
1. Ensure Flask backend is running
2. Set useAIPortrait = true for characters without portraits
3. Fill in aiPortraitPrompt from CharacterDataSetup.md
4. Play scene → portraits generate automatically
5. Save generated sprites to Assets/Art/Characters/
```

### Step 5: Integrate with Existing Systems
```
1. Add Characters AppState to StateManager
2. Create transition from MainMenu to Characters
3. Create transition from Characters to GameStart
4. Add character selection to game state persistence
5. Test full flow: Menu → Select → Gameplay
```

## 🔧 Technical Integration Points

### AudioManager Integration
```csharp
// Already implemented in your AudioManager.cs
AudioManager.Instance.PlayMusic(SoundType.RelaxingGuitar, fadeSeconds: 2f);
AudioManager.Instance.PlaySFX(SoundType.Stamp, volume: 0.8f);
AudioManager.Instance.PlaySFX(SoundType.Pop, volume: 0.3f);
AudioManager.Instance.StopMusic(fadeSeconds: 1f);
```

### StateManager Integration
```csharp
// Add to AppState enum in StateManager.cs
public enum AppState
{
    None,
    MainMenu,
    Characters,      // ← Add this
    FakeNews,
    Profile,
    Ending,
    GameStart
}

// Transition from MainMenu
StateManager.Instance.SwitchState(AppState.Characters);

// Transition to GameStart
StateManager.Instance.SwitchState(AppState.GameStart);
```

### EventManager Integration (Optional)
```csharp
// Add custom events for character selection
public static event EventController.MethodContainer OnCharacterSelected;
public static event EventController.MethodContainer OnCharacterConfirmed;

public void CallOnCharacterSelected(EventData data = null) 
    => OnCharacterSelected?.Invoke(data);
```
