# Complete Card Implementations

Due to the large size of implementing 76 additional cards, I've created 10 Crisis cards already in CardDatabase.cs.

The remaining 76 cards need to be added as private methods before the closing brace of the CardDatabase class.

## Implementation Strategy

Copy the content from RemainingCards.txt and add the following additional cards using the same compact pattern:

### Scandal Cards (10 total) - See RemainingCards.txt

### Absurd Cards (10 cards needed)
- CreatePizzaGate, CreateNationalDance, CreateMemeWar, CreateFlatEarthMovement
- CreateTimeTravel, CreateCloneArmy, CreateGhostWhiteHouse, CreateTalkingStatue
- CreatePortalBasement, CreateAIPresident

### Character Cards (10 cards needed)
- CreateSpinDoctor, CreateGeneralWarmonger, CreateTechBillionaire, CreateFirstSpouse
- CreateVicePresident, CreateChiefOfStaff, CreatePressSecretary, CreateSecretService
- CreateWhiteHouseChef, CreatePresidentialDog

### Normal Cards (46 cards needed)
- Policy cards: CreateEducationReform through CreateSanctions

All cards should follow this compact pattern:
```csharp
private DecisionCard CreateCardName() => new("ID", "TITLE", "Description") 
{ 
    Category = CardCategory.X, 
    Choices = new List<CardChoice> 
    { 
        new(1, "Choice 1") { Effects = new Dictionary<ResourceType, int> { [ResourceType.X] = value } },
        new(2, "Choice 2") { Effects = new Dictionary<ResourceType, int> { [ResourceType.Y] = value } },
        new(3, "Choice 3") { Effects = new Dictionary<ResourceType, int> { [ResourceType.Z] = value }, Alignment = ChoiceAlignment.Chaotic }
    } 
};
```

## Next Steps

1. Read RemainingCards.txt for Scandal card implementations
2. Create similar implementations for Absurd, Character, and Normal cards
3. Insert all before the closing brace of CardDatabase class
4. Build and test
