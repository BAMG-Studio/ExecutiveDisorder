## üìñ Core Concept

Players take on the role of a newly elected leader thrust into a world of political absurdity. Every day presents new decisions through a card-based system. Each choice affects four core resources: Popularity, Stability, Media Trust, and Economic Health.

The game satirizes modern politics through exaggerated characters, ridiculous scenarios, and unexpected consequences. No choice is straightforward, and the "right" answer is often the most absurd one.
